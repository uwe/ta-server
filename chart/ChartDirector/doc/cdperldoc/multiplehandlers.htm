<div class="content">When creating image maps with <a href="BaseChart.getHTMLImageMap.htm">BaseChart.getHTMLImageMap</a>, all data points will use the same image map handler.<br><br>
For example, in a pie chart, if the image map is generated using <a href="BaseChart.getHTMLImageMap.htm">BaseChart.getHTMLImageMap</a> with "piestub.pl" as the handler, no matter which sector is clicked, "piestub.pl" will be invoked. The different sectors are distinguished by different HTTP query parameters.<br><br>
If for some reasons, it is desirable that different sectors use different handlers, the followings are some of the methods:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Produce the image map using <a href="BaseChart.getHTMLImageMap.htm">BaseChart.getHTMLImageMap</a>, with the same handler for all sectors. In the handler, redirect the HTTP request to the "real handler" based on the sector clicked. This is the simplest and recommended method.<br><br>
<li>Use a client side Javascript function as the handler, where "{sector}" is used as the argument to indicate which sector is clicked. For example, "javascript:callMe({sector});" can be used as the handler. In the "callMe" function, the client side Javascript can instruct the browser to load the "real handler".<br><br>
<li>Do not use <a href="BaseChart.getHTMLImageMap.htm">BaseChart.getHTMLImageMap</a>. Instead, use <a href="Sector.getImageCoor.htm">Sector.getImageCoor</a> and <a href="Sector.getLabelCoor.htm">Sector.getLabelCoor</a> to obtain the image map coordinates of individual sectors and sector labels. With these coordinates, one can create custom &lt;AREA&gt; tags for the individual sectors and can put any attributes in them. One can therefore use different "href" attributes for different sectors.<br><br>
</ul>
Although we use pie chart as an example above, the principles apply to other chart types as well.</div><br>
