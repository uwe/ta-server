<div class="content">All ChartDirector database sample scripts described in this documentation are based on a MySQL database. The sample scripts are provided for reference purposes. To actually run the sample scripts, you would need to set up your database system as follows:<br><br>
<ul> <li>Set up a MySQL database server to run on the same machine as your web server. The MySQL database can be downloaded from http://www.mysql.com.<br><br>
<li>Install the Perl DBI module and DBI Driver for MySQL (MySQL module). These modules allow your Perl to access MySQL. They are available from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org).<br><br>
<li>Create a database called "sample" in your MySQL server.<br><br>
<li>Create an account with username "test" and password "test" that can be used to access "sample".<br><br>
<li>Import the table "sample.sql" (located in the "perldemo_cgi" subdirectory) into the "sample" database. </ul>
